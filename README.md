# Necroware's S7-VRM

This project is a Voltage Regulator Module for the Socket 7 mainboards as
defined by Intel in it's Pentium® Processor Flexible Motherboard Design
Guidelines. You can upgrade VRM capable Socket 7 mainboards with this module to
be able to use dual-voltage CPUs like Intel Pentium MMX, AMD K6, AMD K6-2 etc.

*Disclaimer: this VRM can damage your mainboard, CPU or both. Please use at your
own risk.*

__WARNING:__ *inserting the module the wrong way around would put +12V on all
critical lanes. It would destroy the mainboard, the CPU, the memory and all
expansion cards. This can't happen on mainboards with VRM socket, because there
it is not possible to insert it in reverse. On free standing VRM pin header, it
is probably a good idea to cut +12V pin 5 and the unused pin 22 to use them as
a key.*

## CPU Voltage Type Selection (J1)

There are two kind of socket 7 CPUs, single-voltage and dual-voltage CPUs.
Dual-voltage CPUs are designed to use different voltages for the internal core
and for the I/O. The I/O voltage is specified at 3.3-3.5V, but the core voltage
can be much lower. For the very power efficient AMD K6-III+EE the core voltage
is just 1.6V. 

From revision 0.6 and higher the S7-VRM supports both types of CPUs, where
for the single-voltage CPUs the voltage is completely generated on the module
and for dual-voltage CPUs the I/O voltage is generated by a linear voltage
regulator on the mainboard, where core voltage is generated on the VRM module.

To make this work you have to set the jumper J1 accordingly. Please read which
kind of CPU you have before using this module.

Voltage Type | J1 Pos.  | CPU examples
-------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------
Single       | 1-3, 2-4 | Intel Pentium, AMD K5, Winchip C6, Cyrix M1
Dual         | 1-2, 3-4 | Intel Pentium MMX, AMD K6, Cyrix M1L/MII

## CPU Voltage Selection (SW1)

__WARNING__: Single voltage CPUs are designed to run at 3.3-3.5V everything
below that value could potentially make your system unstable. Everything above
that can damage your mainboard or CPU or both. Dual-voltage CPUs usually need
core voltages far below 3.0V, AMD K6-2 for example expects only 2.2V core
voltage and everything above that can potentially damage the CPU. Always pay
attention to the CPU type you use and apply voltages out of spec only if you
really know what you are doing.

__WARNING__: different revisions can have different voltage settings, please
always pay attention and look into the proper documentation for the revision
you have.

Various voltages can be set using the SW1 switch on the module (0=off, 1=on):

  3.3V  |  11011   | Pentium 66-200 (Single Voltage)

  3.5V  |  10111   | AMD K5, Winchip C6
  3.6V  |  01111   | 
  3.7V  |  11111   | *Danger: probably to high for any S7 CPU*


## Important remarks

The transistor Q1 with integrated pull-up resistor is optional. It is used for 
enable/disable signal and is unused on most mainbards.

The PCB is made for a through hole inductor, but if you have only SMD it is also
possible to solder that instead. Keep in mind that the inductor has to stand
the required current. Also slightly different inductors are allowed, everything
between 2µH and 4,7µH should work as well. With the higher inductance you get
less current ripple, also voltage ripple can look better, but the maximum
possible current will decrease. Playing with different inductors will also
influence the compensation network.

Capacitors C7 and C8 are used in so called compensation network and are
responsible for DC-DC converter activation and stability. Those parts are very
delicate and dependent on the ESR and values of the output capacitors C9-C12,
and the inductor L1. If your regulator shows stability issues or not starting
at all, try to remove the capacitor C8. If you change any other parts C7, C8 and
R1 have to be adapted accordingly.

When generating Gerber files:

* The title font is "Edo SZ HQ", available online.
* The board dimensions are 53x62mm.

The inductor doesn't need to be very exact, anything between 2.5µH and 4.7µH
should work, but the sweet point is at around 3.3µH. The inductor can be self
made by using a T50 ferrite toroid. For example T50-26 with permeability 75µ
wrapped in 10 loops of 1.3 mm coper.

## Tested mainboards

This module should run with all mainboards, which provide the VRM module header
as specified in Intel Pentium Mainboard Design Guidelines. Most of such boards
were based on Intel Triton (i430FX) and VIA Apolo Master (MV series) chipsets,
but there were also quite a lot of later boards with newer chipsets (f.e.
i430VX), which supported such an external VRM as well.

Most of the mainboards which were equipped with a VRM option, were produced
before Intel Pentium MMX, AMD K6 and other dual-voltage CPUs were officially
available. However those CPUs have changed the multiplier selection behavior of
CPU pins BF0/1. Not only a new pin was introduced for higher multipliers, but
also pin BF0 was not pulled up internally anymore as it has been done on
single-voltage CPUs before. This ended up in wrong multiplier detection on newer
CPUs like Pentium MMX 200, which would be suddenly detected as 166MHz one. This
can be fixed by adding a 10k pull-up resistor to the CPU between pin BF0 I/O
VCC. In the following table of tested mainboards you can find a column R+BF0
which tells if such a pull-up resistor had to be added to properly support the
multiplier settings.

Faster Super Socket 7 CPUs, like AMD K6-2 and newer added another multiplier
selection pin BF2, which is not supported on those old mainboards at all. It
can be added using another mod, but is actually not necessary. If the CPU
multiplier is set to 2x, those newer CPUs would interpret it as 6x and for
66MHz FSB go directly to 400MHz. However to be able to detect the CPU properly
you would need to mod the BIOS. This is however optional, the system should
work also with outdated BIOS. In such a case the CPU just would not be reported
properly. 

With that in mind this VRM was tested using various CPUs and voltages on
following mainboards:

Manufacturer | Model           | Chipset | R+BF0 | BIOS Mod | VRM Compatible
-------------|-----------------|---------|-------|----------|-------------------
Asus         | P/I-P55TP4XE(G) | i430FX  | Yes   | Yes      | Yes
Gigabyte     | GA-586-ATE/P    | i430FX  | Yes   | Yes      | Yes
